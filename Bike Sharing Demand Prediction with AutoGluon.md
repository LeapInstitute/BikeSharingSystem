# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with AutoGluon

This repository contains my solution for the Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle competition using AutoGluon.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict bike rental demand (count of total rentals) based on historical usage patterns combined with weather data in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded.

## Repository Structure

- `project/bike_sharing_demand_solution.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete solution
- `project/report.md`: Comprehensive report documenting the approach and findings
- `data/`: Directory containing the competition data (not included in the repository)

## Approach

My approach to this problem includes:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing patterns in bike rentals based on time, weather, and other factors
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from datetime and weather data
3. **Model Training**: Using AutoGluon to train and optimize multiple models
4. **Model Optimization**: Implementing techniques like log transformation, bagging, and stacking
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and generating predictions

## Key Findings

- Temporal patterns (hour of day, day of week) are crucial for predicting bike rentals
- Weather conditions significantly impact bike rental demand
- Log transformation of the target variable significantly improves model performance
- Advanced AutoGluon configurations with bagging and stacking further enhance performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- AutoGluon
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

```bash
pip install autogluon
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Download the competition data from Kaggle
2. Place the data files in the `data/` directory
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `project/bike_sharing_demand_solution.ipynb`

## Results

The solution achieves competitive performance on the Kaggle leaderboard using AutoGluon's automated machine learning capabilities combined with thoughtful feature engineering.
